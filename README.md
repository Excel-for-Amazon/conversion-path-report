# Conversion Path Analysis (Excel Files)

**Author:** George Reid  
**Date:** 6th February 2025  

## Description
This Excel analysis tool uses data from the new Conversion Path Report. It identifies the role of different ad types in the customer conversion journey.  
It also pulls new-to-brand (NTB) orders and sales data for Sponsored Products (SP) campaigns.  
Combining these insights in the campaign report helps measure each ad type’s impact and reveals which ad-type combinations can improve performance.  

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open the Excel file.  
3. Import your campaign data into the “Raw Data” sheet.  
4. Review pivot tables to see ad-type roles and NTB metrics.  
5. Compare SP metrics to assess conversion impact.
